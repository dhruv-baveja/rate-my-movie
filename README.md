# Rate My Movie

A bunch of movie lovers were betting for their favourite movies. So to

take it to the next level, they decided to have rating from other people.

For this, they planned to create an app where they can add movies and

other people can rate them.

They have managed to get a UI developer and now they have a nice UI. Now

they have began their hunt for a kick-ass backend developer who can give

the backbone to their app.

So, if you want to help them, just fulfill these requirements:

1. Set up a Django project (Python 3.4.3 and Django 1.8.2)

2. Implement token based authentication.

3. For signup and login, you can either use any third party library or

tool, or you can write REST API endpoints for them

4. User can add a movie and other people, except the creator, can rate

it. And remember a user can only rate a movie once.

5. Design and implement REST API endpoints for adding a movie, rating it.

6. Document these API endpoints in an API.md file

7. Design and implement a task, that sends the average rating of each

movie to all of the admins, at midnight daily

8. Bonus points for tests

9. Don't forget about the code quality

Use the Github Flow (https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)

workflow to develop the above app

so that we can follow along as you code. Note down the assumptions you

make in the README file.

Also write down the API endpoint documentation and database modelling in

the README file.

Use any database that you are comfortable with. Please share the link for

your github repo.
